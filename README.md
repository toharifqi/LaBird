# LaBird

LaBird is my first serious #android project. I started develop this app in the beginning of 2020. This project is offered to me by one of magister student in my campus for thesis purpose. He asked me to develop a learning platform app to allow student study about birds that habitated on Java island.

This app has various features (most of them are gamification feature) like score system, reading materials, video materials, quizes (dialy or per material), birds database (users are able to store their bird's photos and information into our catalog), and users leaderboard to make users motivated when compete each other.

I was entirely using #java at that time because I wasn't too familiar at #Kotlin yet XD. For the back-end, I was using Google #Firebase to provide real-time database, cloud storage, and user authentication.

This project is open to public now since my client has finish his thesis.
